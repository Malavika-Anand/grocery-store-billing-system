Departmental Store Management System is a fast and easy way to keep track of a store’s billing system. This system makes use of File Processing, specifically the General Ledger Problem
Statement as its backbone to help shops manage records of products and customers and to generate bills.
It offers the following functionality:
● Manage Customer: Many stores these days have a customer registration system that keeps
track of the regular customers. This functionality makes the billing process quicker by
remembering the details of regular customers so that such details can be referred to directly
from the computer, instead of asking customers each time.
● Manage Product: This functionality helps the admin keep track of the products sold in the
store by adding new products or modifying existing products’ details.
● Generate Bills: This functionality helps generate a bill with the customer details and the
products bought by the customer.
